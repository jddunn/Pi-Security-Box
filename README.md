# Pi-Security-Box
Python program for a portable security system using a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, and a PIR motion sensor, speakers, and a USB battery. When the motion sensor is activated, a mutable alarm goes off, and the camera records still images several times over a period of three seconds, then the system is reset.
